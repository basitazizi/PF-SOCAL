PF SoCal — Mobile Luxury Homepage (HTML/CSS/JS)

FILES
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/main.js
- assets/logo.svg (placeholder; replace with the real PF SoCal logo if you have it)
- assets/hero-car.png (hero artwork extracted from the mockup)

HOW TO USE
1) Open index.html in your browser.
2) Replace assets/logo.svg with your real logo:
   - Keep the filename the same (logo.svg), OR update the <img src="..."> in index.html.
3) Replace assets/hero-car.png with your own photo:
   - Use a transparent PNG if possible for best blend on black.
   - Keep the same filename to avoid code changes.

NOTES
- The bottom dock is designed for mobile thumb reach.
- Buttons are minimal (no emojis), with a luxury "glass" look.
